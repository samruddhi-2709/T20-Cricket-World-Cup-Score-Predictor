This project predicts the final score of a team in a T20 Cricket World Cup match using in-game variables. The model is built using XGBoost, a state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm, chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and deliver strong performance on structured/tabular data.

Key Features:
* Predicts the final score based on in-game conditions such as current score, balls left, wickets remaining, and run rate.
* Utilizes the XGBoost regression model for high accuracy.
* Can be extended to predict match outcomes under various scenarios.

Technologies Used:
* Python
* XGBoost
* Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
* Scikit-learn for preprocessing and model evaluation.
* Matplotlib for data visualization.
